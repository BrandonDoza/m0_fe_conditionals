# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Somewhat confident, need more practice for sure. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
The same, somewhat confident, just need more exposure to it. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I think I'm getting it pretty well, again, need more time with it. 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
At least 10 hours on the whole thing. When I got stumped I would take my time really trying to pick apart the code to see exactly what was going on, which definitely took up time. Even things that clicked I spent time on making sure I was correct. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice everything. I'm a very hands on and visual learner, so the more exposure I have the better. I'm going to do that by reviewing all of the mod 0 lessons again before the start of class. Repetition will help me. My calendar is good to go for the moment and I have aloted time for this.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No major questions jump out. Again, I just need to keep practicing to get everything to click in my brain. It's like learning a new language, so I've got to just keep repeating it.
